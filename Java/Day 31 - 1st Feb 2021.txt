Question: 

The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, 
and substitutions required to change one string to the other. 
For example, the edit distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is three: substitute the “k” for “s”, substitute the “e” for “i”, and append a “g”.

Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.

Answer:

package com.dailyCodingProblems;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1="kitten";
        String str2="sitting";
        int count=0;
        int min=Math.min(str1.length(), str2.length());
        int max=Math.max(str1.length(), str2.length());
        for(int i=0; i<min;i++){
            if(str1.charAt(i)!=str2.charAt(i)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        count+=(max-min);
        System.out.println("So the edit distance between "+str1+" and "+str2+" is "+count);
    }
}
