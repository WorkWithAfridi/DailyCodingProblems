## Daily Coding Problems and Solutions
This GitHub repository is dedicated to solving coding problems from various platforms such as LeetCode, AlgoExpert, and more. I love to challenge myself with one problem everyday and, in the process, improve my coding skills. This repository serves as a record of my solutions, which I hope will be helpful to others in their coding journey.

## Problem Categories
For the time being I have categorized the problem based on the platform or language I solve them in.
